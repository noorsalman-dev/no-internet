Realistic LEGO shader made in Blender 2.93.8 (the LEGO meshes come from LeoCAD)

By Erik Nordeus, www.habrador.com

Main inspiration comes from:
- https://stefanmuller.com/exploring-lego-material-part-1/
- https://stefanmuller.com/exploring-lego-material-part-2/

Ignored "Mold lines" and "Finger prints" so you have to implement those on your own!


Shader data:

- IOR for lego bricks are roughly 1.5-1.6 -> specular is 0.5 according to equation from https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/render/shader_nodes/shader/principled.html

- Roughness should be 0.25 according to article

- Don't use a denoiser because it makes the small details blurry
